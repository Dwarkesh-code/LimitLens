## Overview

LimitLens is a lightweight browser extension that injects directly into Claude.ai to give you real-time visibility into your session consumption and context window usage — without any page refreshes.

Power users hitting Claude's message limits mid-conversation know the frustration of being cut off unexpectedly. LimitLens solves that with a clean, non-intrusive progress bar that lives inside the Claude interface and updates with every message.

> **Know exactly where you stand before Claude cuts you off.**

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-Time Session Tracking** | Live percentage display of your message limit consumption. Updates instantly on every response. |
| **Context Window Monitoring** | See how much of the context window your current chat is utilizing. |
| **Peak / Off-Peak Indicator** | Know at a glance whether Claude's servers are under high traffic — this directly affects your rate limits. |
| **Session History Logging** | Automatic session logs stored locally and viewable from the extension popup. |
| **Native UI Integration** | Progress bar injected seamlessly into the Claude interface — not a floating overlay. |

## Installation

### ✅ Microsoft Edge Store (Recommended)

Install directly from the Edge Add-ons Store — one click, no setup required.

**[→ Add to Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/oblllhmmeeipboofibdlgmhadidffpmb)**

> Store ID: `0RDCK9G8C2FR` &nbsp;·&nbsp; Version: `2.1.0`

---

### 🛠 Developer Mode (Chrome / Edge)

Run the latest source code locally:

1. Clone or [download this repository](https://github.com/Dwarkesh-code/LimitLens/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the folder.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` (Chrome) or `edge://extensions` (Edge).
3. Enable **Developer Mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder.
5. Pin LimitLens to your browser toolbar.

## How It Works

LimitLens intercepts Claude.ai's internal network responses entirely within the browser. It watches for usage metadata included in Claude's existing API responses and parses it in real-time — no external servers, no polling a third-party API.

**Data flow:**

```
Claude.ai page
      │
  injector.js          ← bridge between extension context and page world
      │
  injected.js          ← runs in page world; intercepts fetch + SSE streams
      │
  content.js           ← receives parsed data; renders UI; writes to storage
      │
  popup_usage.js       ← reads chrome.storage.local; renders popup history
```

| Script | Execution Context | Role |
|--------|------------------|------|
| `injector.js` | Extension context | Dynamically injects `injected.js` into the page world; acts as a message bridge |
| `injected.js` | Page world | Hooks into `fetch` and parses Server-Sent Event (SSE) streams to extract usage data |
| `content.js` | Content script | Receives parsed data via `window.postMessage`; renders the progress bar; persists sessions |
| `popup_usage.js` | Extension popup | Reads persisted history from `chrome.storage.local`; renders the popup UI |

---

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Manifest V3** | Extension architecture — required for Chrome/Edge store compliance |
| **Vanilla JavaScript** | Core logic — zero external dependencies, minimal footprint |
| **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** | Intercepting Claude's streaming token responses |
| **REST API interception** | Fallback parsing for non-streaming responses |
| **`MutationObserver`** | Detecting Claude UI changes and new chat turns |
| **`chrome.storage.local`** | Cross-tab persistence of session history |

---

## Privacy

LimitLens is built with a local-only architecture:

- ✅ **No external servers.** Zero network requests are made by the extension itself.
- ✅ **No analytics or telemetry.** No tracking pixels, no usage reporting.
- ✅ **Conversation content is never read.** The extension only reads usage metadata from response headers.
- ✅ **All data stays in your browser.** Session history is stored in `chrome.storage.local` — on your device only.
